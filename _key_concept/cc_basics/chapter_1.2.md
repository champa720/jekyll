**KEY CONCEPT: Changes and compromises were needed to create and pass the US Constitution.**

*Computers have operating systems that tell them how to work. Programmers update the operating systems as they make improvements and see features that need to be changed. In a similar way, governments rely on operating systems. The United States tried one system that had several bugs in it. Then legislators made changes to the documents that defined the government. In this way, the system became more effective.*
