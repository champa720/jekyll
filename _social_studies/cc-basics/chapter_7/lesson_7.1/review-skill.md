      One of the most important engines of economic growth is entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs are the innovators and risk-takers in an economy. They invent new products, find new ways to provide services, and start new businesses. In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wosniak invented one of the first personal home computers. Instead of inventing new products, some entrepreneurs invent new ways to produce an existing product. Henry Ford did not invent the automobile. Instead, he introduced the moving assembly line to mass-produce automobiles. This innovation enabled Ford Motor Company to dominate the US auto industry in the early twentieth century. Entrepreneurs are not content with the status quo. Instead, they seek innovation, progress, and positive change in the economy.
