          Sample Response

          A new business was started in my town by Moira Smalls. She opened a boutique that sells handmade candy and pastries. Before she opened her shop, many businesses on Main Street were closing. People had stopped shopping there, and they got in the habit of driving to the mall in the next town. Ms. Smalls leased an empty storefront and opened her business. With hard work and patience, the business began to grow. Her shop was featured in a national magazine. More people began visiting her shop. Other businesses on Main Street benefited from the increased foot traffic. Now Main Street is doing better, and the local economy is improving.
