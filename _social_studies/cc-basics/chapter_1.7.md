## Opportunities and Challenges Global Society

In today's world, people communicate instantly across vast distances. Travel is easier and faster than ever before. This seemingly smaller world is known as the global society. It presents many opportunities, perhaps most obviously in the economic realm, or area. Businesses can expand across the globe, and individuals can transact, or carry out, private business from one country to another via the Internet. Opportunities also abound in education, politics, and government. Today's technology makes it easier than ever before to engage in meaningful dialogue, or discussion. Technology also provides a way to reach those who previously had no access to information or education.

Internet technology allows people around the globe to communicate quickly and easily. This has a deep impact on society. For example, social media, especially Facebook and Twitter, played a significant role in the 2011 uprisings referred to as the Arab Spring.

Today's global society also presents important challenges. Because world markets are all interconnected, an economic slowdown in one country affects all countries. Terrorism and the spread of nuclear arms are two serious problems in the world today. Health threats (such as AIDS) and environmental issues (such as climate change) are also global in scope. Censorship and human rights violations in one part of the world threaten freedom everywhere.

### The US Role

The United States is a superpower. It has a responsibility to meet the challenges and explore the opportunities of the global society.

The State Department, which is part of the executive branch of the federal government, is responsible for US relations with other countries. The department helps ensure the safety and well-being of US citizens living or traveling in foreign countries. It also has responsibilities for foreign aid and international trade agreements.

#### Foreign Aid

Foreign aid is the help that one country offers to other countries. This aid can take many forms, including money, food, arms, and skilled personnel. US foreign aid promotes US interests abroad in the areas of both foreign policy and economics. It also helps people around the world and promotes democracy.

The major federal agency involved in managing US aid programs is known as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Aid programs are operating in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe and Eurasia, and the Middle East. The agency offers aid in such areas as agriculture, government, environment, and education.

#### Trade Agreements

Trade agreements are legal agreements or contracts relating to trade between two countries. US trade agreements are generally seen as beneficial to the US economy, although some people believe that US jobs can be lost as a result of these contracts.

In March 2013, the United States had free trade agreements (FTA) with 20 countries. The largest of these agreements was created in 1994, when the North American  Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) became effective. NAFTA permits trade with virtually no taxes or other restrictions between Canada, Mexico, and the United States. In 2012, the United States and other Pacific nations, including Australia, Chile, Malaysia, and Canada, began negotiations on a new FTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).

The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization of 154 countries that provides a place for countries to negotiate trade-related issues, settle trade-related problems between nations, and keep trade flowing freely. The United States is a member of this group.

#### The Spread of US Culture

An interesting effect of the global society has been the spread of US culture to other countries. Blue jeans, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, American movie stars and musicians-these common features of daily life in the United States can be found across the globe. More and more, English is used for teaching at universities as diverse as Spain and South Korea. US universities are also setting up campuses around the world.

### US Businesses Expand Globally

Just as US culture has spread across the world, so have US businesses. China, in particular, has seen the rise of many US businesses, whose workforces and profits have grown dramatically in recent years. Manufacturers such as Caterpillar find that the building boom in China has increased the need for Caterpillar products. Companies such as Starbucks, McDonald's, General Motors, and Motorola have found huge Chinese markets as well. Even small unknown companies have found that opening a Chinese branch is worthwhile.

There are two main reasons that US companies are interested in China. First, China's membership in the World Trade Organization has contributed to a growth in foreign investment. Second, improved financial opportunities in China have led to the growth of a Chinese middle class that can afford to buy foreign products.

While US business in China has exploded in recent years, US companies earn their highest profits in Japan. One US company, Aflac, has made as much as 70 percent of its profits in Japan. Other US businesses that have thrived are Coca-Cola, Apple, and McDonald's. Many other corporations operate around the globe. Walmart, for example, has retail stores in 27 countries outside the United States.

### Fair Trade

The fair trade movement has arisen in recent years. Fair trade is trade that meets certain standards: workers are paid a living wage, and their working conditions are safe. Leaders of this movement insist that workers are not helped enough by free trade agreements. This is especially true in developing countries, where farm workers, for example, earn extremely low wages. The fair trade movement seeks to obtain a better price for goods so that workers can be paid better wages.

To accomplish its goals, the fair trade movement has devised a labeling system. Products-such as coffee, bananas, and handicrafts- that bear the fair-trade label have met health, safety, labor, and human rights standards.

### US Nonprofit and Humanitarian Organizations

Beyond the government agencies that work to aid developing countries and countries that have suffered from natural disasters and war, the United States also has many private groups that seek to help in the same way. These groups are called nonprofit organizations, or nonprofits. Nonprofit means "not for the purposes of making money." Nonprofit organizations pour all money they earn into realizing the goals of their organization.

CARE is one well-known US-based humanitarian group. It seeks to eliminate poverty and to better the circumstances of women around the world. Doctors without Borders is a humanitarian organization created in France, but it has a branch in the United States. It sends volunteer doctors to help the victims of natural disasters, war, and famine. There are thousands of other US organizations that work to improve the lives of fellow humans around the world.
