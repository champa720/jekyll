In this chapter you will study these topics:

## Lesson 3.1: World War II, the Cold War, and the 1950s

In the 1930s, under Adolf Hitler's leadership, Germany conquered other European nations. This, along with the military actions of Italy and Japan, led to World War II. After World War II, the United States developed a policy that tried to stop the spread of communism.

## Lesson 3.2: Protest and Politics

The 1960s were a time of great social and political change in the United States. African Americans used nonviolent protests to gain civil rights. The civil rights movement inspired women and other minorities to fight for their rights.

## Lesson 3.3: US Foreign Policy in the Modern Era

From 1950 until the collapse of the Soviet Union, US foreign policy focused on stopping the spread of communism. Doing this meant that the United States became involved in conflicts around the world, in places such as Korea, Vietnam, Cuba, and Berlin. One result of the Cold War was the space race, a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to develop space technology.

## Lesson 3.4: Societal Changes

During the 1970s, the United States dealt with inflation and an energy crisis brought on by rising oil prices. President Nixon resigned because of the Watergate scandal. In the 1980s, the United States became more conservative under Presidents Reagan and Bush. In the 1990s, the economy, helped by new technologies, grew and the nation prospered.

## Lesson 3.5: The United States in the Twenty-First Century

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led to US military action overseas, most notably in Afghanistan and Iraq. During the first decade of the new millenium, the United States and other nations experienced economic problems, which led to the Great Recession of 2009. In 2009, Barack Obama became the nation's first African American president.
