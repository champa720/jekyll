    answer:
      - option: B
        text: A direct democracy will work only in a group that is small enough so everyone can voice an opinion and vote on every policy. A government in which leaders represent the citizens is a representative democracy, and a nation that describes government powers in a constitution is a constitutional democracy. In a nation led by an absolute ruler, the people will not be consulted.

        text: Only an absolute monarchy is headed by a king or queen.
      - option: B

      - option: C
        text: In a constitutional monarchy, the ruler's power is mainly ceremonial, and a prime minister governs the country. In an absolute monarchy, the ruler's power is unlimited.
      - option: D
        text: Only an absolute monarchy protects the rights of citizens.
    answer:
