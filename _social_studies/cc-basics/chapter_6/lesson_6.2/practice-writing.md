          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          It seems like every day there are fewer gas stations here in town. One by one, the stations are closing or being bought out by Gas Guzzle. Soon there will be only one gas station in town. Gas Guzzle already has higher prices than most of the other stations. Once there is no competition, Gas Guzzle will have no reason to keep its prices down. People will have no choice but to pay whatever Gas Guzzle demands. The business will profit, but the people will suffer.
