          The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) program, which was set up during the Great Depression, was a huge help to people who had savings in a bank. Many banks failed during the Depression, and people lost all the money they had deposited. The FDIC insured accounts in banks that were members of the Federal Reserve System. Since the FDIC was established, bank customers get their money back if their bank fails. When I set up a savings account, I will make sure my bank is insured by the FDIC.
