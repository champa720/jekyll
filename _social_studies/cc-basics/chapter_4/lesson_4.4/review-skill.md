      The CAFTA-DR free trade agreement will eventually eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between the United States, Central America (the countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua), and the Dominican Republic. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), Central America and the Dominican Republic currently make up the second-largest export market for US goods and services. Tariffs on information-technology products, construction equipment, paper products, cotton, wheat, soybeans, and some fruits and vegetables were removed immediately.
