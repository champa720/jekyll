          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          Both politicians and diplomats are involved in government. A politician is elected to public office; in contrast, a diplomat is appointed. For example, the  president (who is voted into office) is a politician, while the secretary of state (who is appointedby the president) is a diplomat. Both the president and the secretary of state may discuss issues and negotiate with foreign leaders.
