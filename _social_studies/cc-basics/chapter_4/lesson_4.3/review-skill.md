      What is the difference between international affairs and domestic affairs? Both have political, economic, and social aspects. Both are important in every presidential administration. Both are the subject of laws passed by Congress. International affairs, however, involve other countries. Domestic affairs, on the other hand,  involve only the United States. International affairs include matters such as foreign aid, wars, and trade relationships. Domestic affairs include health-care reform and tax cuts. International affairs are dealt with mainly at the national level, while domestic affairs affect national, state, and local levels of government.
