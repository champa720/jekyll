          (pro) Under the ten-year leadership of Wen Jiabao, China has blossomed. Today private ownership of business has led to growing prosperity of the middle classes. Many more people own cars and live in comfortable, modern homes. Because China has strengthened economic and political ties with the West, some say democracy is peeking over China's horizon.
          <br /><br />
          (con) As Wen Jiabao makes his exit, he will leave behind a China characterized by poor homeless people haunting the streets of ghost cities built for an upper middle class that has never materialized. Despite his talk of a move toward democracy, his government has clamped down on free speech and has increased military spending.
