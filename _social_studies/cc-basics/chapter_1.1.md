title: Types of Modern and Historical Governments
description: >
  Throughout history, people have formed governments. Three types of government are common today: democracy, monarchy, and dictatorship. None of these types are new. For example, more than two thousand years ago, some of the Greek sity-states had democratic governments, but this was not the same type of democracy that we have in the united States today.

    Have you ever been part of a sports team or planned a family reunion? The people who lead such groups or events decide how things should be done and who will do what. These people have something in common with different types of governments. Local and national governments accomplish many of the same tasks, but they operate on a larger scale.

## Identify Types of Government

Throughout history, people have developed different forms of government, or ruling authority. Three types of government are common today. A monarchy is a government in which a king or queen serves as head of state. A democracy is a government in which the people decide what kind of society they will have and what laws and services they want. A dictatorship is a government in which one person decides how the government functions and what the laws are. Each of these basic forms of government has variations.

### Monarchies

Monarchies were one of the earliest forms of government. As people began to live in groups, the strongest leaders took charge. Kings and queens passed on their leadership roles to their sons or daughters. Early monarchs had absolute power-they made all decisions. But by the year 1215, the power of monarchs began to weaken. In England, the barons (men who had been given land by the king in return for their loyalty) were angered by King John's cruel conduct and high taxes. They forced the king to sign the Magna Carta, a document limiting his power.

Gradually the power of monarchs became more limited. In 1789, for example, the French Revolution brought an end to King Louis XVl's absolute power. Constitutional monarchies replaced the earlier monarchies.

Today there are only a few monarchies. Japan and Norway, which have written constitutions, are examples of constitutional monarchies. The United Kingdom is also a constitutional monarchy, though it does not have a written constitution. Instead, the country is governed according to an accumulation of laws and treaties created over several centuries. Queen Elizabeth II, the current ruler, has no real political power.

### Democracies

One of the first democracies developed in Greece in about 500 BC. All male citizens could help govern. This was a form of direct democracy, in which each citizen voted on policies and laws. However, a large portion of the population had no rights. Women, slaves, and non-Greeks could not take part in government.

Democracy did not become a common form of government for hundreds of years. But in the 1700s, people in Europe began to push for greater freedom. Many of their efforts resulted in constitutional monarchies. This set the stage for the first modern democracies.

The colonists who came to America knew about the changes in government that were occurring in Europe. When Americans won their freedom, these new ideas about government led to our representative democracy. Other countries, however, took different approaches. Canada, for example, developed a parliamentary democracy. Canadians vote for representatives who become members of their parliament, or legislature. The leader of the political party with the most seats in parliament becomes the prime minister. This means the nation's chief executive answers to representatives rather than directly to the people.

### Dictatorships

A dictatorship is a government ruled by one person or by a small group that has absolute power. The dictator determines the laws and holds power over everyone in the country. Dictators often come to power by force or by misleading the people. Adolf Hitler of Germany and Idi Amin of Uganda were dictators.
