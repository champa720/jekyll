## The Expansion of Civil Liberties

Civil liberties are the freedoms that protect individuals from the government. Being able to act and think without interference from the government is a right we often take for granted. The civil liberties we enjoy are guaranteed in the Constitution. In 1789 several states agreed to a new federal Constitution on the condition that a Bill of Rights be added. Two years later, the first ten amendments became part of the highest law of the nation. States often added a Bill of Rights to their own constitutions.

The Bill of Rights exists to protect citizens against abuses by the federal government. The first amendment guarantees four freedoms: freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom to assemble, or gather, peacefully.

The first part of the amendment states that there will be" .. . no law respecting an establishment of religion." This is known as the establishment clause. A clause is a section in a legal document. This clause means that the United States does not have an official religion. The next clause is known as the free exercise clause. It says that the government cannot make laws that keep people from worshiping as they choose.

Freedom of speech refers not only to the spoken word but also to symbolic acts such as burning a flag or wearing a T-shirt with a slogan on it. The writers of the Constitution wanted to assure that people could criticize the government without fear of being imprisoned.

The third clause, freedom of the press, refers to the written word. The newspapers-and also the electronic media- are free to publish criticism of the government and government officials. The press has two major responsibilities: to inform the public and to act as a check against the government and elected officials. The press is free to write what it wants in order to fulfill these tasks.

The last part of this amendment makes sure that people can gather peacefully to discuss political ideas. In addition, people can petition,  or formally question, when they feel their rights have been violated by political institutions or elected officials.

The remaining amendments in the Bill of Rights cover a variety of topics, such as being protected against unreasonable searches and seizures. This means that government officials need a search warrant to enter a home.

In the same way, we cannot be seized, or arrested, without a warrant. Double jeopardy (being tried twice for the same crime) is illegal. Citizens cannot be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment. Trials are to take place quickly, and they must be public.

Some of these provisions, or legal statements, can be interpreted in a variety of ways. What does the right to bear arms mean? What are cruel and unusual punishments? People have gone to court to define these ideas.

The last amendment in the Bill of Rights refers to powers not specifically given to the federal government and not specifically forbidden to the states. The states have these powers.

### Gains and Losses in African American Suffrage

When the Framers wrote the Constitution, they had in mind the rights of men like themselves. This was also true of those who wrote the state constitutions. At first, only white men who owned property could vote . Gradually other groups gained suffrage, or the right to vote.

In 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment ended slavery, but it did not extend suffrage to African Americans. The Fourteenth Amendment stated that everyone born or naturalized (made a citizen) in the United States was a citizen and had all the rights of a citizen. The Fifteenth Amendment stated that the right to vote could not be denied on the basis of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude."

The states that had seceded from the Union at the beginning of the Civil War needed to be reinstated. Conditions of their rejoining included accepting these amendments and rewriting their constitutions to incoporate them. State constitutional conventions took place in 1868.

Despite the new constitutions, efforts were made to disenfranchise African American males in the South, that is, to take away their right to vote. The poll tax-a tax on voters-was one attempt. Poor people, both African American and white, often did not have the money to vote. The Twenty-Fourth Amendment (1964) made poll taxes illegal.

Another device used to disenfranchise African Americans was a literacy test. When people came to vote, they were given a section of the Constitution to read and explain. African Americans were given very difficult passages, while whites were given simple passages.

Women Gain the Right to Vote

In 1848, a group met in Seneca Falls, New York, at the invitation of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a young mother, and Lucretia Mott, a Quaker. Stanton wrote a Declaration of Sentiments, modeled on the Declaration of Independence. The Seneca Falls convention called for an extension of women's rights, among them the right to vote. This was a radical notion at the time. In many states, women could not own property, divorce their husbands, or have sole custody of their children.

In the last half of the 1800s, some states, generally in the West, gave women limited voting rights. In 1869, Wyoming became the first state to grant this right. In 1916, Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman elected to the House of Representatives. Ten states west of the Mississippi River had granted women full suffrage by 1912.

The movement split into two groups. African American women-who realized that many white women, especially in the South, were opposed to black women voting-formed their own groups.

Then another generation took up the cause. Their demands intensified after World War I, in which women had aided the war effort and worked as nurses.

Women were the first to use the nonviolent tactics that later would be popular in the civil rights movement. In 1917, more than 200 women were arrested for civil disobedience. Some were force fed when they went on hunger strikes in prison. Women picketed the White House and lobbied members of Congress. Thousands marched in parades demanding full voting rights. Some lost their jobs, health, homes, or families.

President Wilson finally supported the suffragists in 1918 and encouraged Congress to pass the amendment that had first been proposed to the Senate in 1878. The Nineteenth Amendment was ratified in 1920. It was the largest single extension of voting rights in the nation's history.

### Civil Rights for African Americans

African Americans remained largely disenfranchised in many states. They continued to experience discrimination, or unfair treatment, as a result of prejudice. The effects of poll taxes and literacy tests meant that the rights of full citizenship and equality, or civil rights, were effectively denied to them. Further Supreme Court rulings and Constitutional amendments were needed before African Americans had full rights.

In 1954, the Supreme Court reversed a decision it had made in 1896. That decision had declared that "separate but equal" facilities, including  schools, restrooms, and restaurants, were legal. In the 1954 decision Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, the Court recognized that racial segregation in public schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment.

The poll tax was abolished in 1964 with the passage of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. That same year, the Civil Rights Act made discrimination in employment, education, and voter registration illegal. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 made literacy tests illegal.

The effect of these new laws was dramatic. In 1940, only 5 percent of African Americans in the South were registered to vote. This figure rose to 66 percent in 1969. The voting laws also changed who was elected. In the mid-1960s, about 70 elected officials in the South were African Americans. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, the number had grown to about 5,000. African American members of Congress increased during that same time from 6 to about 40.

### Civic Responsibilities

As citizens, Americans have not only rights, they also have responsibilties. These include obeying the law, paying taxes, and acting as a juror. Failure to perform these duties can lead to fines or imprisonment. Citizens also have voluntary responsibilities, such as voting.
