      <b>The English Bill of Rights</b><br />The 1600s were a time of conflict between the British king, the English people, and Parliament (the British legislature). The conflict ended in 1689 when new monarchs, William III and Mary, accepted the English Bill of Rights. This document helped create a constitutional monarchy. The English Bill of Rights stated that the monarch served at the will of Parliament. The Bill of Rights strengthened the rights of common people; For example, people could no longer be taxed simply because the king wanted money. Laws could not be changed without Parliament's approval. Members of Parliament were to be freely elected. The Bill of Rights guaranteed a just and fair government that answered to the people.<br />

          The authors of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were descended from English people, so English law would have influenced their thinking. They knew that the English Bill of Rights had protected the people from the king, and they thought all people should have those same rights.
