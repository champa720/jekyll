          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          The First Amendment guarantees the right to speak freely. Recently I felt the government had made a mistake by passing a new tax law. I wrote a letter to the editor of my local newspaper, and the letter was printed. Because I have freedom of speech, I can write what I feel, even though I am criticizing the government. Because of freedom of the press, the newspaper cannot get in trouble for printing my letter. If we did not have these freedoms, I would have had to keep silen t or risk going to jail.
