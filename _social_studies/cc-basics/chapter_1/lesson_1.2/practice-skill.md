      <blockquote>In 1987, the Supreme Court heard the case of Bethel School District #43 v. Fraser. A student at Bethel High School made an obscene speech to an assembly of students and was suspended. The student, Fraser, argued that his right to freedom of speech was violated. However, the Supreme Court ruled that students do not have a First Amendment right to make obscene speeches in school. This case is an example of the Supreme Court's limiting the meaning of an amendment. The decision shows that there are conditions to freedom of speech.</blockquote>
