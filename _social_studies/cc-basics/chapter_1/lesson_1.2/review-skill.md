      Until 1933, presidents were inaugurated in March following the November election of the previous year. In 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected president. The outgoing president, Herbert Hoover, was blamed for the economic troubles of the Great Depression. About 25 percent of the nation's people were out of work, and the situation did not improve during the four months following the election. The new president had no authority to resolve the financial crisis. To avoid the problems that occurred with a powerless president, the Twentieth Amendment to the Constitution moved Inauguration Day to January 20. Congressional sessions were to begin on January 3 so that Congress could have drafts of new laws ready for the incoming president.
