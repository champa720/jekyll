      <b>The Supreme Court Reverses Itself</b>
      People make the laws and interpret them according to their beliefs. What the Constitution "really means" is subject to judicial review. Although the Constitution has changed little over the years, the values of society have changed. This has led to new rulings on earlier decisions. Consider these two cases concerning racial segregation:
      <ol>
      <li>In 1896, in a period marked by extreme expressions of racial discrimination, the Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that segregation in public facilities, including public schools, was constitutional so long as the facilities were "separate but equal."</li>
      <li>In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled, in the case of Brown v. the Board of Education that "separate but equal" schools were unconstitutional and they violated laws granting equal protection.</li>
      </ol>
