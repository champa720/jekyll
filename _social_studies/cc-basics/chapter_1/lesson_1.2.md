    Computers have operating systems that tell them how to work. Programmers update the operating systems as they make improvements and see features that need to be changed. In a similar way, governments rely on operating systems. The United States tried one system that had several bugs in it. Then legislators made changes to the documents that defined the government. In this way, the system became more effective.

## The US Constitution

After the Revolution, the new nation was deeply in debt. In 1786, farmers in Massachusetts took part in Shays's Rebellion. They seized courtrooms to prevent mortgage foreclosures. After seven months of fighting, the militia put down the rebel Union with little bloodshed. The conflict, however, showed the need for a strong central government. Some aspects of the economic crisis, especially problems of interstate commerce, had to be dealt with. It was clear that the Articles of Confederation, the agreement made by the original thirteen states to establish the United States as a nation, needed to be changed.

A Constitutional Convention was called. It began meeting in Philadelphia in May 1787. Its purpose was to amend the Articles of Confederation.

To prevent the leaders of the central government from becoming too powerful, the new government would be based on the principle of separation of powers; that is, the government would be divided into three branches. The legislative branch was to enact laws. The executive branch, headed by_the president, was to administer the government. The federal judicial (court) system was created to settle disputes and legal matters. This system of checks and balances was designed to prevent any single branch.of government from having too much power. Another important issue was the fair distribution of power between large and small states. To resolve the issue, two separate bodies were created in the legislative branch. Each state received equal representation in the Senate. Representation in the House of Representatives was determined by the size of the state's population. In this way, the House protected the rights of large states, and the Senate protected the rights of small states.

The Constitution addressed other areas of government as well. Sections discussed choosing the president, structuring the federal court system, and amending the Constitution. The finished Constitution was sent to conventions in each of the thirteen states. It needed to be ratified by nine states before the Constitution became the law. Eleven states had ratified the Constitution by March 1789.

### Key Principles of the Constitution

The framers of the Constitution relied on eleven key ideas when writing the Constitution. These ideas are explained in the chart below.

| Principle | What It Means |
|:-|:-|
| Popular Sovereignty | The government gets its power and authority from the people. |
| Federalism | Power is shared between state and national government. |
| Separation of Powers | Responsibilities are shared among three branches of government, each with its own powers. |
| Checks and Balances | Each of the branches of government has some control over the other. |
| Judicial Review | The judicial branch (the courts) can declare a law passed in Congress or an action taken by the president to be unconstitutional. |
| Limited Government | The national government can do only what the Constitution specifically states it can do. |
| Natural Rights Philosophy | Government has authority only because the people give it authority to protect their natural rights. |
| Constitutionalism | A constitution limits a government's power. |
| Majority Rule and Minority Rights | The majority rules, but it must respect and protect the rights of individuals. |
| Rule of Law | Laws are clear and fair, and no one is above the law, not even the government. |
| Individual Rights | All people naturally have certain individual rights, such as life, liberty, and property. |

### Amendments to the Constitution
At the first session of Congress in 1789, popular pressure forced the Constitution's supporters to add ten amendments aimed at protecting individual rights. This Bill of Rights gives citizens the following freedoms:

  * {: .collection-item } freedom of speech and the press
  * {: .collection-item } the right to assemble and petition the government
  * {: .collection-item } the right to keep and bear arms
  * {: .collection-item } protection against unreasonable search and seizure
  * {: .collection-item } the right to trial by jury  
  * {: .collection-item } the right to due process and protection against self-incrimination
  * {: .collection-item } the right to a public trial
  * {: .collection-item } the right to have an attorney
  * {: .collection-item } protection against excessive bail or cruel or unusual punishment
  * {: .collection-item } separation of church and state
  {: .collection }
  
Congress submitted this guarantee, or assurance, of rights to the states. All ten amendments were approved by 1791. Since the Bill of Rights, seventeen more amendments have been added. Each amendment has been passed to solve a problem. Only one amendment has been repealed, or withdrawn. The Eighteenth Amendment (1919) prohibited the drinking and sale of alcohol. It was repealed by the Twenty-First Amendment (1933).

The procedure for changing the Constitution is complicated. Amendments must be proposed by a two-thirds majority vote of both houses of Congress or by two-thirds of the state legislatures. Amendments must be approved by three-fourths of the states. Because of this complex procedure, many proposed amendments have never been ratified. For instance, the Equal Rights Amendment passed Congress in 1972. However, it was not adopted because it fell short of the 38 states required for ratification.

The seventeen amendments passed after the Bill of Rights fall in three broad categories, or groups. One category is amendments that extend voting rights and the power of voters. Among the more important examples of this group are the Fifteenth (1870), guaranteeing African American males the right to vote; the Nineteenth (1920), giving women the right to vote; and the Twenty-Sixth (1971), lowering the voting age to 18. A second category is amendments that change the powers of state and national government. For example, the Thirteenth (1865) abolished slavery, the Fourteenth (1868) granted citizenship to the former slaves, and the Sixteenth (1913) established the federal income tax. The final group involves changes in the function or structure of government. One example of this category is the Twenty-Second (1951), which limits a president to ten years in office.

Even with its amendments, the Constitution is short, probably shorter than the bylaws of many organizations. It has vague guidelines concerning the powers and functions of the different levels of government. However, this flexibility has allowed the Constitution to survive as a symbol of national unity. The meaning of its various paragraphs has constantly evolved as the country has grown and changed.
