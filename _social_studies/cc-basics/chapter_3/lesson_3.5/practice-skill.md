      The politicians pushed it through Congress even though "we the people" were clearly opposed to it. We took it to the Supreme Court, but even the justices sided with those spendthrift liberals in the White House and Congress. Now we're stuck with Obamacare. Now we all have to buy health insurance, whether we want it or not-and whether we can afford it or not. If we don't buy it, we have to pay anyway because they'll fine us. What's more, Obamacare is too expensive. It's going to mean more government spending and more government debt. The Affordable Care Act isn't affordable for Americans, and it's not affordable for America either.
