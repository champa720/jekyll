      The idea that global warming is a fact is absurd! There is no reliable technology that can predict long-term climate change. Most weather technology can't even correctly predict tomorrow's weather. If the world's temperature is meant to rise, then what does human activity have to do with it? Even if there is an increase in climate temperature, there would not be much difference when the increase is spread out over hundreds of years. Meanwhile, attention and resources are being used to fight this "issue" when they should be fighting real issues like poverty and nuclear weapons.
