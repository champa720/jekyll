      Betty Friedan was an author and a leader of the modern women's rights movement. After graduating from Smith College in 1942, she became a writer and political activist. Her most famous book, The Feminine Mystique, was published in 1963. The book grew out of surveys that she had taken of her classmates from Smith. These surveys showed that despite their education and subsequent successes, the women were unhappy with their lives. The book became a best seller. In 1966, Friedan and other feminists formed the National Organization for Women (NOW). NOW worked to get women equal access to education and pay that was equal to the pay of men.
