      In 1942 the US government instituted the Bracero program to bring farmers from Mexico to the Southwest. In Spanish, bracero means "farmer." Thousands of workers came to the United States to help harvest crops in t he Southwest. Braceros were considered temporary farm workers. They signed contracts written in English . These workers were often exploited, or taken advantage of.
      <br /><br />
      Jesus Campoya Calderon was one of these braceros. He describes his experience:<br />"In the farms we would do anything, although our permit was to pick cotton only... I worked four months, seven days a week, at least 12 hours every day and I took home almost $300 dollars... Those were very good days..."

      During the Cold War, the Soviet Union blockaded ground supply routes to West Berlin, Germany. For ten months, supplies were airlifted into the city by the United States and Great Britain. Lt. Gail S. Halvorsen noticed children watching the planes come in. After talking with a group of these children, he began to drop tiny parachutes with candy and gum attached. Other pilots and crews soon begin dropping parachutes too. These pilots became known as the "Chocolate Flyers."
