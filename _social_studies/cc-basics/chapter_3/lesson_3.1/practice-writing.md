          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          I think there could be a world war today, but it would not start in Europe. I think it would be more likely to begin in the Middle East. Right now there are conflicts between the strict rulers and the people who want more control of their government in Syria, Iran, and several other Middle Eastern countries. If countries such as France and the United States support the people and countries such as China and Russia support the rulers, an international conflict could begin. Suddenly a fight in one small county could become a big war that spreads around the world.
