          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          I receive a large number of benefits from the government. My mail is delivered by a US postal worker. I drive on roads that are paved and maintained with tax money. I went to a public school paid for with state and local money. I voted in the last election, and elections are run by the government. Every day I feel safe because police officers enforce laws. When a building in my neighborhood caught fire, firefighters put out the flames, and paramedics took the injured to the hospital.
