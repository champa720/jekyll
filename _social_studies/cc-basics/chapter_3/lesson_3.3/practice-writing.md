          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          Dear Madame President, As you take office, I hope you will think about the needs of young people in this country. Every job seems to require a college degree. However, the price of education keeps going up, so young people can't afford to go to college. If they do, they have to borrow money for tuition, books, and living expenses. This means they may leave college with more than $50,000 of debt. How many years do you think it will take them to pay back their debt? They will never be able to buy homes or send their own children to college. Please find a way to help Americans get the education they need without going bankrupt.
          <br />Thank you,
          <br />Eddie Kang
