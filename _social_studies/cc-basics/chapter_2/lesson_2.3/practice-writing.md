          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          Dear Mother,
          <br /><br />
          Today I signed up to fight for the Union. I don't know what awaits me, but I know I can't stay working in a cozy office while my friends and my brother march off to fight for what is right. A hundred years ago, this country was run by king and parliament. If we are going to stay a free nation, we have to stick together. The Rebels can't just decide they can strike off on their own because they don't like the president. I am not going to let that happen. I know you don't want to lose both sons to this war, but we have to think beyond the family. Please don't cry, and please be proud.
          <br /><br />
          Your loving son,
          <br /><br />
          Philip
