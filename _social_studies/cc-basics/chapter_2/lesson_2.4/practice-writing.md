Think about a labor strike that you have heard about. or (if you are a union member) think about the effect your union has on your job. Write a letter to the editor for your local newspaper about an important labor union issue.

          Sample Response

          From what I can tell, labor unions are just another for-profit industry. They force members to pay dues, but they do little to help the members. Over the past few years, many people have lost their jobs. Those who kept working went without raises, and some even got pay cuts. Where were the unions? Benefits were slashed. Where were the unions? It seems to me that we would all be better off if we could just keep those extra dollars in our pockets and stop paying big salaries to union bosses.
