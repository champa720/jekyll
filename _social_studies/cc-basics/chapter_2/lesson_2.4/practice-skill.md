      <blockquote>Women even more than men need the ballot to protect their special interests and their right to earn a living... We want a law that will prohibit home-work... We hear about the sacredness of the home. What sacredness is there about a home when it is turned into a factory, where we find a mother, very often with a child at her breast, running a sewing machine? Running up thirty-seven seams for a cent. Ironing and pressing shirts seventy cents a dozen, and children making artificial flowers for one cent... These women have had no chance to make laws that would protect themselves or their children.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>...[Men] discriminate against the class that has no voice. Some of the men say, 'You women do not need a ballot; we will take care of you.' We have no faith in man's protection... Give us the ballot, and we will protect ourselves.</blockquote>
      Excerpted from Up Hill with Banners Flying, by Inez Haynes Irwin
