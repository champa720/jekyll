          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          A chain of events led to US independence from Britain. First, to raise money, the British government increased taxes on the American colonists. This led to the colonists protesting the new tax laws and boycotting English goods. Because of the protests, the British sent troops. The result was that the first shots of the revolution were fired. In response, US delegates met in the Second Continental Congress, where they formed an army under General George Washington. The following year, they issued the Declaration of Independence. After a five-year war, the British surrendered. Because of these events, the United States was finally free to become an independent nation.
