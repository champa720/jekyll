      The Iroquois League of Nations, which formed before AD 1500, linked five tribes under a single government. The Iroquois League functioned with a Grand Council of male chiefs who represented the five clans. These leaders met to discuss common issues and to reach agreements. John Rutledge of South Carolina had encountered this tradition when he was attending a congress in New York. Years later he suggested that some of its provisions become part of the government structure of the new nation.
