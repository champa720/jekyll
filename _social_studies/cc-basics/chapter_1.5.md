    When you watch a sports event, generally you are rooting for one of the teams. You have a point of view, and it influences the way you evaluate the referee, the other team, and even the band and the cheerleaders.<br /><br />Political parties and interest groups also have points of view in favor of ideas and policies or against them. Politicians generally identify themselves with one party. Interest groups can advocate, or promote, one particular issue, or they can support an industry or a specific group of people.

## Ideas and Influence in Politics

When representatives take office, many people try to influence, or have an effect on, their decisions. Individuals, groups, and organizations try to get support for their interests.

### Political Parties

The US Constitution did not provide for political parties. However, leaders of the young nation soon found themselves grouping together to gain support for their ideas.

Some nations have a one-party system. Dictatorships, where differing opinions are not allowed, often have one-party systems. Countries such as Cuba, China, and North Korea have one-party systems. Some other countries, such as Germany, have multiple parties. These parties may work together in coalitions ( teams made up of several parties that join together for a common purpose).

In the United States, however, two major parties have dominated the political system since the 1800s. The Democratic Party officially began in  1848. It is the oldest continuously active political organization in the world. The Republican Party began in the 1850s as a third party- that is, a party other than one of the two major parties.

Each party has an animal as its symbol. Thomas Nast, a famous cartoonist of the late 1800s, was first to use the donkey to represent the Democratic Party and the elephant represent the Republican Party. Today the donkey and elephant are well-known symbols.

Political parties  select presidential candidates at national conventions. Since the 1850s, there have been 18 Republican presidents and 14 Democratic presidents.

Presidential elections are held every four years. In the summer before the November election, each party meets for a convention. The candidates for president and vice president are officially introduced. Before these meetings, key party members develop a statement of issues that the party supports. This document is called a platform. Each individual issue, such as health care reform, is called a plank.

Many people vote for the same political party at each election. Others consider themselves independents. They switch parties depending on the issues or candidates. Sometimes they support third parties, such as the Libertarian or Populist parties. Third parties tend to have narrower interests compared to the broader platforms of the two major parties.

### Interest Groups

An interest group is a group that tries to influence political decisions. They may represent the interest of the public (clean water), the economy (the pharmaceutical industry), institutions (colleges), or groups (the American Cancer Society). Interest groups may act on the local, state, and national levels. Some interest groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, are global in their efforts.

Many groups have lobbyists, people who work to influence legislation. When issues of interest to the lobby are scheduled for debate in Congress, lobbyists try to persuade members of Congress to vote in a way that will benefit their group. They may also try to get government funding for their causes or organize protests against measures they do not support.

Following World War II, political action committees (PACs) formed to help raise money for candidates running for office. The first PAC was formed to support union interests. Soon a PAC supporting business interests was formed. Today some PACs, such as the National Organization for Women, support an idea. Other PACs are formed by members of Congress to support their ideas and to help them get re-elected. People connected to these PACs may campaign for their candidate.
