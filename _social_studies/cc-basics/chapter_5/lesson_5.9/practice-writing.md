Have you purchased items on credit that you did not need, simply because a credit card purchase was so easy? Has your credit card company charged you interest on your account? End your paragraph with a one sentence conclusion summarizing your opinion of credit card use.

          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          My history of using credit cards has had its ups and downs. When I got my first credit card, I bought a lot of items that I didn't really need and couldn't afford. I was paying the minimum amount each month, and the interest almost made me broke. After a year, I canceled my card, but it took me a couple more years to pay off my debt. Recently I managed to qualify for another credit card. I use it very carefully. I don't want to get into financial trouble by overspending again.
