      Q: Why do I want a copy of my credit report?<br />
      A: Your credit report has information that affects whether you can get a loan, and how much you will have to pay to borrow money. You'll want to keep a copy of your credit report to.
      <br /><br />Make sure the information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date before you apply for a loan for a major purchase like a house or car, buy insurance, or apply for a job.
      <br /><br />
      Help guard against identity theft. That's when someone uses your personal information, like your name, your Social Security number, or your credit card number, to commit fraud. Identity thieves may use your information to open a new credit card account in your name. Then, when they don't pay the bills, the delinquent account is reported on your credit report. Inaccurate information like that could affect your ability to get credit, insurance, or even a job.

          Sample answer: A credit report that gives incorrect information might mean that I would not get a loan. If an identity thief has been using my Social Security number, I might have many unpaid bills listed on my record. If my record shows unpaid bills, an employer might not hire me because I would look like an irresponsible person.
