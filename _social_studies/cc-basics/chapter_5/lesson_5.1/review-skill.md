      News about large businesses grabs most of the headlines. However, small businesses are an important part of the US economy. Generally speaking, a small business is a firm that employs fewer than 500 workers. In 2008, more than 99 percent of US businesses were small businesses.

Keeping small businesses healthy is important for US economic prosperity.
