  In any economic system, limited resources force people to make choices. People cannot have everything they want. The study of economics helps us analyze the best way to use our limited resources.

    Scarcity, which is a universal economic problem, requires individuals and societies to make choices about how to use their limited resources.

- example: >
    Suppose your best friend coiled you, hoping to meet you at the mall on Saturday afternoon. You may have already planned to run errands during that time, however. You can't do both activities at the same time. Because your time is limited, you have to choose to do one activity and not the other.
    <br /><br />
    The economic choices people make operate in a similar way. Resources, such as time, ore limited-but there are many ways these resources con be used. Individuals, businesses, the government, and others must choose which resources will best meet their wants and needs.

## Scarcity and Choice

Sometimes people ask why we bother studying economics. There are many possible answers to this question. Most economists say that we study economics so we can learn how to deal with the problem of scarcity. Scarcity is the shortage of goods. It occurs because people have unlimited wants or needs, but they have limited resources for satisfying those wants and needs. To put it more simply, we cannot have everything we may want. Scarcity is often called the universal economic problem because people in every society, past and present, have faced scarcity.

People have tried to overcome scarcity by improving the ways goods and services are produced. For example, during the Industrial Revolution, manufacturing was changed from small-scale cottage industries (people working at home to produce goods) to mass production in large factories. These factories also transformed how the factors of production were used. The factors of production are the key resources used to produce goods and services. The three main factors of production are natural resources (land), human resources (labor), and capital goods (capital).

| Factors of Production | Definition | Examples |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Natural Resources, land |natural features or materials | oceans, wild animals, forests, minerals |
| Human Resources, labor | the time and effort of workers | factory workers, doctors, teachers, farmers |
| Capital Goods, capitol | items designed to produce other goods | tractors, computers, office and factory buildings |

Unfortunately, changes that occurred during the Industrial Revolution did not mean workers and their families had easier lives. In fact, large factories often became sweatshops. Laborers were forced to work long hours under unpleasant and dangerous conditions for little pay. Technology had made production more efficient (productive without being wasteful) and had increased output, but scarcity was not eliminated.

Scarcity forces us to make choices about how to use limited resources. When a business has a scarcity of one or more of the factors of production, the business may have difficulty producing its product. People also face scarcity. For instance, you may want to see a new movie, shop for shoes, and go out to dinner. However, you have only enough money to do one of these things. Your scarce resource is money. You will not be able to do everything you would like to do; you'll have to choose which activity is the most important or the most necessary.

### Choices Involve Costs

When we think about the cost of something, we normally think about the price of items we purchase. For example, if you choose to buy a coat, the "cost" to you is the price you paid for the coat. Economists tend to look at cost in a different way. They measure the true cost by what a consumer did not buy, by what a business did not produce, or by what goods or services the government did not provide. This is called the opportunity cost. It is the item or service that was not purchased.

#### Consumer Choices

Suppose Janet has $20 to spend on Saturday night. Janet narrows her plans to two choices. She can buy a movie ticket and treats at the theater, or she can buy a large pizza. If Janet buys the pizza, the opportunity cost is what she gave up, in this case, the movie ticket and treats.

#### Business Choices

Similarly, businesses face opportunity costs when they decide what items  to produce. Suppose Clara's Clothing Outlet can produce two types of clothing, T-shirts and sweatshirts. Because of the size of the business and the number of available workers and machinery, Clara's Clothing can produce 1,000 T-shirts per day or 500 sweatshirts per day. If the business chooses to produce the 1,000 T-shirts, the opportunity cost is the 500 sweatshirts that were not produced.

#### Government Choices

Even the government confronts opportunity cost. Suppose your town needs to upgrade local schools and also needs to upgrade the water-treatment plant. Each project will cost $10 million. However, the town has only $10 million to spend. If your town spends its scarce financial resources ($10 million) to upgrade local schools, the opportunity cost is the improvement of the water-treatment plant.

### Graphing Opportunity Cost

Graphs organize data to show trends and relationships. The production possibilities curve (PPC) is a graph that shows all possible combinations of two products that suppliers might produce. If the supplier produces more of one product, it will have to cut back on the production of the other product. This is because the supplier's resources are limited. Economists assume that available resources are being used efficiently. The suppliers of products could be businesses, government, or the entire economy.

#### Production Possibilities Table

Clara's Clothing Outlet can produce 1,000 T-shirts or 500 sweatshirts per day, but not 1,000 T-shirts and 500 sweatshirts. The business can also choose to produce some T-shirts and some sweatshirts. The following table shows some of the combinations of T-shirts and sweatshirts the business can make.

**Production Possibilities (Daily}**{: .center-align }

| Product | Points | Points | Points | Points |
|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| | A | B | C | D |
| T-Shirts | 1,000 | 800 | 500 | 0 |
| Sweatshirts | 0 | 200 | 400 | 500 |

![Production Possibilities Curve](-ppc.png){: .responsive-img .materialboxed }

Notice option A-if the firm produces 1,000 T-shirts, 0 sweatshirts are produced. This is the case when all of the firm's resources are used to produce T-shirts. With option B, however, some of the firm's resources are switched from the production of T-shirts to the production of sweatshirts, so the firm can produce 800 T-shirts and 200 sweatshirts. With option D, all of the firm's resources are used to produce 500 sweatshirts, and no resources are available to produce any T-shirts.

#### Production Possibilities Curve

A PPC plots the numbers from the production possibilities table on a graph. This graph shows how the increased production of one item (sweatshirts) causes a drop in the production of a second item (T-shirts). The vertical axis of the PPC shows how many T-shirts Clara's Clothing Outlet might produce in a single day. As you can see, the firm could produce from O to 1,000 T-shirts. The horizontal axis of the PPC shows how many sweatshirts the firm might choose to produce, which ranges from O to 500.
