      The ABC Widget Factory makes widgets, useful gadgets that help customers open jar lids. Recently the factory outsourced the production of one part of the widget to another country. This step reduced the cost of labor and increased profits. However, some workers were laid off, so morale in the factory fell. In response, the president of the company hired new directors of production and marketing. These two new directors have been given the task of raising morale and increasing profits.
