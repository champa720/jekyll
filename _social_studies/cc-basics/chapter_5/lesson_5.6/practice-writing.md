          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          I think we could improve customer service at Quick Stop if we had more training on how to bag groceries. We are wasting time and using too many plastic bags. We could improve the appearance of the shop by replacing the old mat at the front door. All of us would be happier working in a place that looked cleaner and neater. Finally, I think we could improve our profits if we found a vendor who would give us a better price for bakery goods. We are paying too much for some of the food we sell. If we pay less to vendors, we will have bigger profits.
