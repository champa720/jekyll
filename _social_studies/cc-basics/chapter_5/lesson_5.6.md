## Making a Profit

In a capitalist economy, businesses exist to make a profit. Profit is the income left after subtracting expenses. To make a profit, a business must do a good job of managing the land, labor, and capital needed to make a product. Economists refer to these elements as the factors of production. Land refers to the land and all the natural resources used. Labor includes all the physical effort, skills, and knowledge of the workers. Capital is the physical materials-such as buildings, machines, and supplies-needed to run the business. Income must be greater than the cost of land, labor, and capital to make a profit. One way to keep expenses down is to increase productivity, or output.

Productivity is usually measured by how many goods are produced for each hour of labor. For example, a group of workers produces 60 cars per hour. Together they are paid $1,000 per hour. If the workers could make 120 cars per hour, they would increase their productivity by 100 percent. Then, if they are still paid $1,000, the business owner has reduced the cost of labor. By increasing productivity, the owner has reduced the cost of one of the factors of production.

Decreasing any factor of production should increase profit. Businesses can reduce their electrical costs by replacing old light bulbs with more efficient CFLs. They can cut mailing costs by relying on e-mail. They can ask vendors to provide bids, helping the business buy goods and services at lower costs. Some businesses lower their costs by moving production to a foreign country.

Another important way for a company to increase profits is to increase sales. Advertising is one way to sell more of a product. A business may also raise the price of its goods and services so it will have a greater profit.

## The Role of Incentive in Making a Profit

Incentive, or motivation, plays a role in every aspect of business. People respond to both positive and negative incentives when making business decisions. This is true of people running a company, employees working for a company, and customers buying the company's products.

Profit is an important incentive for taking the risk of starting and running a business. People will spend their savings, take out loans, and work nonstop to build up a new business. The chance to make more money is part of what motivates them.

Wages, plus bonuses and tips, are also a powerful incentive for workers. Yet money is not the only incentive for working hard. When employees rate their job satisfaction, their paycheck is just one factor in what makes them happy on the job.

What other factors are incentives for workers? Good working conditions are important. It is hard to focus on work in a space that is noisy, crowded, or too hot or too cold. Employers must make sure their workers feel safe and comfortable on the job. A good employer also thinks of the emotional needs of employees. Company policies, workloads, and the attitude of coworkers all affect the emotional environment of the work place.

Incentive also plays a role for customers. It is the job of the marketing staff to study what customers want and then to come up with ads that encourage customers to buy a particular product. The ads must show how the product will benefit buyers in some way. Good marketing increases sales, which in turn increases profits.
