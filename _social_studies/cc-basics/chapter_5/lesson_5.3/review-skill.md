      In the election of 1928, Herbert Hoover, a Republican, was elected president of the United States. He was sworn in as president in March 1929. In the fall of 1929, the New York Stock Exchange, the largest stock market in the United States, crashed, and many investors lost money. Soon the United States dipped into a depression. Unemployment rose and national output declined during President Hoover's term of office (1929-1933) . Factories were idle, and unemployed workers sank into despair. Many people could not make their monthly mort~age payments, and thousands of families were evicted from their homes. Shantytowns, sometimes called Hoovervilles, sprung up all over the country. One thing is clear: President Herbert Hoover was solely responsible for the collapse of the US economy in 1929.

      The following is an excerpt from President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Inaugural Address, delivered to the American people on March 4, 1933, at the height of the Great Depression. 
      <blockquote>Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruitment by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>... There are many ways in which it [the economy] can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by talking about it. We must act and act quickly.</blockquote>
