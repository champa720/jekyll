          Sample Response
          <br /><br />I shop for sale prices by watching the websites of my favorite stores and waiting for items I like to be marked down. If I'm lucky, I can get a good deal. If I'm not lucky, the item I want will sell out before it hits the price I'm willing to pay. I think the store owners offer low prices to get rid of old merchandise and make way for new things. They may also want to get back as much money as they can at the end of a season.
