    Banks and other financial institutions connect people who want to save money with people who want to borrow money in a regulated US financial system.

- example: >
    At some point. you have probably borrowed money from a family member or a close friend. You likely promised to repay the money in the near future. The core of this agreement is that the lender, in this case your relative or friend, trusted you to repay the debt.
    <br /><br />
    Banks and other fi.rms that lend money operate in a similar way. Banks accept deposits from savers and grant loans to borrowers-usually individuals or businesses. A bank makes a loan only if it believes the borrower will repay the loan with interest.

## Money and Its Uses

Money is anything that people generally accept in exchange for goods or services. Money has been used for thousands of years. It has taken many forms, including coins, paper currency, shells, cacao, even stones.

##### Functions of Money

Money has three main functions.

  * {: .collection-item }Money is a medium of exchange. People use and accept "money" to buy goods or repay debts.
  * {: .collection-item }Money is a standard of value. Each item offered for sale has a monetary value, or price. The price of an item tells its value compared to other items.
  * {: .collection-item }Money is a store of value. Money holds its value over time. If a society's form of money quickly lost its value, people would not accept money in payment for goods or services.

##### Types of Money

Today the US currency is fiat money. Fiat money is money that has value because the government says it has value. Note the words that are printed on US paper currency: "This note is legal tender for all debts public and private." This means that businesses in the United States must accept the currency in payment for goods or services.

In the past, two other types of money have been used in the United States: commodity money and representative money. Commodity money is a form of money that is valuable in itself. Bales of cotton and tobacco were used as money in some parts of America during the colonial era. Representative money is backed by something valuable, such as gold. For much of US history, our paper currency was backed by gold or silver.

### The Money Supply

The money supply is the amount of money available for use at any one time. Economists have several ways to measure the amount of money in our economy.

The most common measure of our money supply is called the Ml. The Ml consists of currency (bills and coins), traveler's checks, and check-able deposits (money held in people's checking and savings accounts). A summary table of Ml is shown here.

| Components of Ml | Dollar Amount ($ billions) |
|:-|:-|
| Currency | $2,000 |
| Traveler's checks | $4 |
| Check-able deposits | $451 |
| Total Ml | $2,460 |

### Financial Institutions

We normally think of banks when we discuss saving or borrowing money. However, a bank is just one type of financial institution that provides financial services to people. Other financial institutions are savings institutions and credit unions. Financial institutions collect deposits and extend loans. They also provide a wide variety of financial services. 
##### Commercial Banks

A commercial bank is a for-profit firm that provides many financial services to people. Commercial banks accept deposits and make loans to businesses and individuals.

##### Savings Institutions

Savings institutions, or "thrifts," focus on making loans to  individuals rather than to businesses. The two main types of savings institutions are savings and loan associations (S&Ls) and savings banks. These institutions extend mortgage loans so people can buy homes. They also make small personal loans to consumers for purchasing cars and making home repairs. Most savings institutions are for-profit.

##### Credit Unions

Credit unions are owned by their members. They give home mortgage and personal loans to members. Credit unions are not designed to earn profits. As a result, they typically offer higher interest rates on members' savings deposits. They may also offer lower interest rates on money that members borrow.

### Government Oversight of Financial Institutions

Over the past century, the federal government has become more active in monitoring and strengthening the US banking and financial system. Two of the most important watchdogs are the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve System. These agencies often assist each other in safeguarding the country's financial well-being.

##### Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

The FDIC was created in 1933 to provide federal insurance for bank deposits. Thousands of US banks had collapsed during the early years of the Great Depression. The FDIC and other government actions reassured Americans. Almost overnight, "panic runs" to withdraw money from the banks stopped.

The FDIC was created as an independent agency of the federal government. It receives no tax dollars to support its work. Instead, it raises funds by collecting premiums from banks and savings institutions. Other revenues are earned from FDIC investments. This money is used to stabilize the banking system and to support the FDIC operations.

The main responsibilities of the FDIC are to supervise banks and savings institutions and to resolve financial problems when they arise. If a bank fails, the FDIC helps negotiate the sale of the failed bank to a stronger bank. Some FDIC money may be needed to complete the sale. However, in most cases, banking functions at these failed banks continue without interruption.

##### The Federal Reserve System

The Federal Reserve System, often called the Fed, is the central bank of the United States. It was created by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913. As our central bank, the Fed supervises the banking system and provides services to strengthen the financial system. The Fed also creates monetary policy to stabilize the entire economy.

The creation of the Fed followed a series of financial crises. The most serious of these crises was the Panic of 1907, a time when people feared large-scale bank failures. Worried depositors made panic runs on the banks. This threatened the country's entire banking system because the government was unable to stop the panic. Banking giant J. P. Morgan and other major bankers restored order by loaning money to weak banks.

The Fed was created as an independent agency of the federal government. Like the FDIC, the Fed does not rely on tax dollars. Instead, it earns revenues from fees paid by banks, interest earned on its investments, and other transactions.

How does the Fed monitor and strengthen the US banking system? One way is by supervising the nation's banks. Supervision ensures that banks follow laws and rules. The Fed also provides some financial services. For instance, technologies used by the Fed help the government process Social Security checks, help people pay bills electronically, and help banks clear checks. The Fed also makes sure that banks have enough money to meet their needs. The ability to quickly supply money to banks helps create confidence among savers and prevent panic runs.

##### Other Agencies

While the FDIC and the Fed are the largest government watchdogs, other federal agencies also help monitor and protect the financial system. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) oversees thousands of credit unions. It also administers the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF), which provides insurance protection for people who deposit their savings in credit unions. The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) helps regulate savings institutions such as S&Ls and savings banks.
