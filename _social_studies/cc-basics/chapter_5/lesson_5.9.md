    Would you like to have more money than you do? Do you worry about your financial future? These are probably the easiest questions you will ever be asked! Of course, everyone could use more money, and no one wants to worry about the future. One key to a brighter financial future is furthering your education. Another is learning about personal finance.

## Personal Finance

Personal finance refers to the financial affairs of an individual or a family (rather than the finances of a business or the government). Finance means "anything to do with money." Personal finance includes your income, bills, and savings.

Money has a big influence on your plans for the future. Whether you are making short-term goals like going to a movie and buying new pants or making longer-term goals like going to college and opening a business, you need to have money. Achieving your goals requires financial planning. This type of planning lays out organized steps to guide you in spending money, saving money, and paying back any debts you may have.

Setting up a personal budget, or an outline for spending and saving, is a useful financial planning tool. A budget shows how your monthly income will be used for expenses such as rent, food, taxes, insurance, education, transportation, debt repayment, and entertainment. Sample budget forms can be downloaded from the Internet, along with suggestions for creating your budget. Professional financial planners can also be helpful to you, particularly in planning how to pay back large debts.

## Banks and Checking Accounts

There are banks in every town and city in the country. Banks are private businesses that provide money-related services. Although some banks are called "state banks" or "national banks," these banks are not run by the state or national government. These terms tell whether the bank is operating under state or federal (national) laws.

Banks make money by charging their customers for services. Before you open a bank account, ask about service charges. Often you can limit what you pay the bank by knowing why the bank charges fees. Sometimes you can even avoid paying bank charges.

Most banks are commercial banks. A commercial bank is a large financial institution that offers a wide variety of services. Credit unions are another important type of bank. A credit union is owned and run by its members. Credit unions offer the same services that commercial banks offer, but credit union fees are often less than commercial bank fees.

Most people use banks in order to have a checking account. A checking account is a bank account that lets account holders write checks and use an automated teller machine (ATM) card to get cash. Account holders deposit, or place, money into their accounts. They withdraw, or take out, money by writing checks or using an ATM card.

Typically people deposit their paychecks into their checking accounts and then write checks to pay for their rent, utilities, and other bills. Many employers will deposit paychecks directly into their employees' accounts. The US government will deposit Social Security checks and tax refunds directly into checking accounts.

It is important to record every deposit and withdrawal from your account. This lets you calculate your current account balance. The account balance is the amount of money in the account. Writing a check for more than the account balance can cause a lot of problems. The bank will charge you a fee if you do not have enough money in your account to pay for the check. If you do this often, the bank may close your account. In addition, you will probably be charged a fee by the business you wrote the check to.

## Saving for Your Future

Keeping money instead of spending it is called saving. There are many reasons to save, and there are many ways to do it.

Why should you save? People save money so they can purchase an expensive item like a car or a house. They save for major expenses like community college tuition. They also save for unexpected emergencies like medical bills.

How do you save? There is an old saying "Pay yourself first." This means that the first payment you make every month should be a deposit into your savings account. A savings account is a bank account where you store money.

Where should you keep your savings? Saving cash is not a good idea. Cash can easily be lost or stolen. The best place to keep your saved money is in a savings account at a commercial bank or credit union. Savings accounts pay interest. Earning interest is the key to making your savings grow.

Suppose you save $25 a week, or $100 a month. In a year, you would have saved $1,200. If your savings account pays 5 percent interest, you will have $1,227.89 at the end of the year. That extra $27.89 might not sound like a lot, but you did no work to earn it. The next year, you will earn interest on the money you put into the account and on the interest you already earned. After five years of saving $100 a month, your savings will total $6,000 without interest-or $6,861 with interest. You can see the long-term benefit of putting money into a savings account that earns interest!

## Understanding Credit

You can buy things with cash, or you can buy them with credit. Using credit is a way of taking ownership of something before you pay for it. The word credit comes from an old Latin word that means "trust." When a company sells you an item on credit, it is trusting you to pay the bill.

You probably know how a credit card works. When you charge an item to the credit card, the seller gets the money from your credit card company. You are responsible for paying the credit card company. In addition to paying for the item, you may also have to pay interest. Every time you use a credit card, you are taking out a loan from the credit card company.

There are some advantages to using credit cards. You do not need to carry a lot of cash. You can make purchases online or over the telephone. Items bought on credit may also be easier to return if you decide you do not want them.

Using credit wisely and paying your credit card bill on time will help you build your credit score. Your credit score is a report of how well you pay your bills. Banks and other institutions report your bill-paying habits (for example, whether you pay bills late) to credit agencies. Credit agencies determine your credit score. This score is available to companies that you want to borrow money from. If you want to take out a car loan, a good credit score will help you get the loan and let you pay a lower interest rate. A bad credit score can mean that the loan will be denied or that you will pay a higher interest rate.

One disadvantage of using credit cards is the temptation to buy more things than you can afford. Interest rates on credit cards can be very high, and late payment fees are costly. Many people go into debt by using their credit cards unwisely, and then they struggle for years to pay off the debt.
