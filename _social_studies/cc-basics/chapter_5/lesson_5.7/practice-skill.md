      Three friends have opened a sandwich shop. They work together to manage and run the shop. Each person takes orders, makes sandwiches, and rings up sales. Customers compliment the managers on the food, but they complain about slow service.

    text: How can the three sandwich shop owners improve their productivity?
    choice:
      - option: blank
    answer:
      - text: >
          Sample answer: The three owners should specialize and divide the labor. It is not efficient to have each person doing all three tasks. One person should take the orders and pass them to the second person. That person should make the sandwiches. The third person should ring up sales. All three of them will become more skilled (and faster) at their jobs when they do not keep switching tasks. If business improves, the owners may need to take on a fourth person to help make sandwiches.
