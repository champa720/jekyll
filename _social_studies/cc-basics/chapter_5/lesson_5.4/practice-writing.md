          Sample Response
          <br /><br />
          Banks and credit unions provide similar services to customers. A commercial bank is operated for profit; its goal is to make money for its owners and investors. A credit union is owned by its members; it is not designed to earn profits. Both institutions offer loans to individuals. Banks also offer loans to businesses.
          <br /><br />
          I would like to do my banking at a credit union. The savings interest may be higher, and the loan interest lower. This is because no bank owner is making a big profit. I might be giving up some convenience because my local credit union does not have branch offices, but I wouldrather stick with an institution that looks out for the people it serves.
