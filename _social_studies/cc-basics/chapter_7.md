Think about all the things you do in an average day. You get dressed and perhaps drive to school or work, use a computer, watch television, and cook your meals. You might be surprised to learn how many of the things you use in a day has been imported from another country. Oil, cars, and medicines, as well as cell phones, computers, and other electronic equipment are all leading imports in the United States.

In this chapter, you will learn about how economies work on a national and international scale. As you read, think about how much of what you buy is imported from other countries and why we import so many products.

In this chapter you will study these topics:

## [Lesson 7.1: National Economic Performance](lesson_7.1)

A number of indicators can show a country's economic health. These include the unemployment rate, the gro~s domestic product, and the rate of inflation or deflation. Economic growth is based on efficient use of natural resources, labor, and capital goods.

## [Lesson 7.2: Global Markets](lesson_7.2)

Greater economic globalization has meant more companies and workers are involved in the exchange of goods and services between countries. The pace of globalization has increased with new technologies. Global institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization, and the United Nations help maintain the global economy.
